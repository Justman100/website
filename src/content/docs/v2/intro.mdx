# Introduction

## What is Umami?

Umami is a simple, fast, privacy-focused, open-source analytics solution. Umami is a better alternative to [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/)
because it gives you total control of your data and does not violate the privacy of your users.
